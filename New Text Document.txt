I’ve added a new project to my portfolio — realtime-chat, a small but functional real-time chat app.
It’s simple, clean, and built to work smoothly without unnecessary complexity.

What it does:
• Sign up / log in with JWT authentication
• Create and join channels (e.g., General, Random, Tech Talk)
• Send and receive messages instantly via Socket.IO
• Store message history in a database for persistence

Tech stack:
• Backend: Python, Flask (REST API), Flask-SocketIO, SQLAlchemy + SQLite, JWT auth
• Frontend: React + Vite, Socket.IO client, Axios, responsive UI

The goal was to practice building a complete app from backend to frontend, focus on clean code, and keep the UX straightforward.
It’s not a “big launch” — more of a practical, working project that’s easy to run locally and nice to have in my portfolio.
